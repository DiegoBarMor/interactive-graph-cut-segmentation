        <h1>Interactive Graph Cut Image Segmentation</h1>

        <h2 id="#introduction">Introduction</h2>
          Interactive image segmentation techniques are a promising alternative to fully automatic segmentation. They take a small human input as ground truth and then expand it via an algorithm to segment the image with (hopefully) more realistic and useful results. <br><br>

          The method described in <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> and <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> was implemented in Python and can be found <a href="https://github.com/DiegoBarqueroMorera/interactive-graph-cut-segmentation" target="_blank">here</a>. The goal of this method is to segment an image into two parts (binary segmentation): <b>object</b> and <b>background</b>. A user provides a set of pixels that are certain to be part of the object, and another set of pixels certain to be part of the background. Both sets are denominated <b>seeds</b> for object and background respectively.
          <br><br>

          Taking into account both sets of seeds, the image is first represented as a directed graph. Then, the image is segmented by finding the optimal <i>cut</i> of the edges of the graph, by exploiting the <i>max-flow min-cut</i> theorem. In the next sections, a brief introduction of these concepts is presented, as well as the details of the algorithm and the Python implementation.
